Use classic WordPress menus as a block with horizontal, vertical, or dropdown/accordion layouts.

== Description ==

The **Simple Menu Block** plugin allows you to include classic WordPress navigation menus as a block in the block editor. It supports three layouts:  
- **Horizontal**: Display menus in a single row.  
- **Vertical**: Display menus stacked in a column.  
- **Dropdown/Accordion**: Display menus in an expandable/collapsible style for better usability on smaller screens.

Easily configure your menu's layout using block settings while retaining the flexibility of the classic menu system.
